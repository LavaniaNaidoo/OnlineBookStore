  <br> Forever Books started back in 2017, where a group of like-minded individuals decided to join forces and start an online book store! <br>
  Our small team (when we first started), loved everything about books. From the way they looked, felt and smelt etc. to the way they made us want to escape our realities and be a part of a small world otop a few hundred words on a page. <br>
  It was safe to say that our dreams were needing to be fulfilled with this incredulous urge to share the same dreams with millions across the world. <br>
  Suffice it to say, it was a difficult task to do. Starting a book company that could cater internationally. We struggled for a year and a half before we finally got the green light to officially open our store! <br>
  A few years later, we are a flourishing company, with our jobs being able to bring life and joy back into reading a book itself! <br>
